# Day 1: DevOps Fundamentals

## Introduction
- DevOps is a culture that enhances software delivery by integrating development and operations.
- Aims to improve efficiency, speed, and collaboration in software projects.

## What is DevOps?
- Not a tool or technology, but a **set of practices** to accelerate application delivery.
- Enables faster, more reliable software updates with automation and monitoring.

## Why DevOps?
- Traditional IT was slow and inefficient.
- DevOps **reduces deployment time** from weeks to hours.
- Ensures **rapid bug fixes**, **security updates**, and **continuous monitoring**.

## Core Pillars of DevOps
1. **Automation** – Reduces manual effort.
2. **Quality Assurance** – Ensures reliability.
3. **Continuous Testing** – Maintains high standards.
4. **Monitoring & Observability** – Tracks system health.

## DevOps vs Traditional IT
| Feature           | Traditional IT | DevOps |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Delivery Speed** | Weeks/Months | Hours/Minutes |
| **Manual Effort** | High | Low (Automated) |
